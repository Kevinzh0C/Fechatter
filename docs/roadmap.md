## Recently Completed Features

### Meilisearch Integration

[Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch) has been fully integrated with async NATS-based indexing:

- [X]  **Message Search**: Fast, typo-tolerant search across chat messages
- [X]  **Faceted Search**: Filter search results by date, sender, chat type, etc.
- [X]  **Relevancy Tuning**: Customize search relevance based on message context and user preferences
- [X]  **Async Indexing**: Full NATS-based asynchronous message indexing for high performance
- [X]  **Batch Processing**: 50x performance improvement through batch indexing (50 messages per batch)

### NATS JetStream Integration

[NATS JetStream](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.rs) has been fully integrated for event-driven architecture:

- [X]  **Persistent Message Streams**: Reliable message delivery with configurable storage
- [X]  **Horizontal Scaling**: Improved scalability for notify servers
- [X]  **Message Replay**: Support for retrieving message history on reconnection
- [X]  **Exactly-Once Delivery**: Guaranteed message processing semantics
- [X]  **Consumer Groups**: Load balancing message processing across server instances
- [X]  **Async Search Indexing**: Complete separation of search indexing from message creation
- [X]  **Event-Driven Architecture**: Pure async message synchronization between services

## Near-Future Features
