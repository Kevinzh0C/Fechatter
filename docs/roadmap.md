# Fechatter Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Fechatter chat application, including completed features, upcoming integrations, and future enhancements.

## Features Already Developed

Fechatter currently provides the following key features:

- **Multiple Chat Types**: Support for one-on-one conversations, group chats, private channels, and public channels
- **Workspace Management**: Multi-tenant architecture with isolated workspaces for organizations
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure user authentication with refresh token support
- **Real-time Messaging**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time notifications and message delivery
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API for chat, user, and workspace management
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable data persistence with efficient schema design
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error management across the application
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns between chat functionality and notification delivery

## Immediately Upcoming Features

### Meilisearch Integration

[Meilisearch](https://github.com/Kevinzh0C/meilisearch) will be integrated to provide powerful search capabilities:

- **Message Search**: Fast, typo-tolerant search across chat messages
- **Search-as-you-type**: Real-time search results with sub-50ms response times
- **Faceted Search**: Filter search results by date, sender, chat type, etc.
- **Relevancy Tuning**: Customize search relevance based on message context and user preferences

### NATS JetStream Integration

[NATS JetStream](https://github.com/Kevinzh0C/nats.rs) will enhance our real-time communication infrastructure:

- **Persistent Message Streams**: Reliable message delivery with configurable storage
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Improved scalability for notify servers
- **Message Replay**: Support for retrieving message history on reconnection
- **Exactly-Once Delivery**: Guaranteed message processing semantics
- **Consumer Groups**: Load balancing message processing across server instances

## Near-Future Features

### Backend and Frontend Integration

- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern React-based UI with TypeScript
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components for chat interfaces
- **State Management**: Efficient client-side state management with real-time updates
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities with offline message queuing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for frontend-backend integration

### ChatGPT Chatbot Service

- **AI-Powered Responses**: Integrate ChatGPT for intelligent chat assistance
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintain conversation context for natural interactions
- **Custom Commands**: Support for chatbot commands within regular conversations
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Connect chatbot to company knowledge base
- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatic translation and language detection

## Future Considerations

### OpenTelemetry Monitoring

- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing across services
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and usage metrics for all components
- **Logging Integration**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Service Health Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring of system performance
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of system issues

### Pingora Gateway Configuration

[Pingora](https://github.com/Kevinzh0C/pingora) will be implemented as an API gateway:

- **High-Performance Proxy**: Efficient HTTP routing with Rust performance
- **TLS Termination**: Secure connection handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and traffic spikes
- **Request Filtering**: Security filtering and validation
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent traffic distribution across services
- **Observability**: Detailed request logging and metrics

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation strategy follows best practices from the [System Design Primer](https://github.com/Kevinzh0C/system-design-primer), including:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Design all components for horizontal scaling
- **Consistent Hashing**: Efficient distribution of connections and data
- **Failure Resilience**: Graceful handling of component failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Regular profiling and optimization
- **Security First**: Security considerations at every layer of the application
